===================================
Authenticate to the Rackspace Cloud
===================================

Whether you use cURL, a REST client, or a command line client (CLI) to send
requests to the |apiservice|, you need an authentication token to include in the
``X-Auth-Token`` header of each API request. You get a token by submitting an
authentication request with valid account credentials to the following
Rackspace Identity API service endpoint:

.. code::

       https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0

With a valid token, you can send API requests to any of the API service
endpoints that you are authorized to use. The authentication response includes a
token expiration date. When a token expires, you can send another authentication
request to get a new one.


.. note::
     For more information about authentication tokens, see the following topics
     in the Rackspace Identity API documentation.

     - :rax-devdocs:`Authentication token operations<cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/token-operations>`

        The examples in the Getting Started Guide show how to authenticate by
        using username and API key credentials, which is a more secure way to
        communicate with API services. The authentication token operations
        reference describes other types of credentials that you can use for
        authentication.

     - :rax-devdocs:`Manage tokens and token expiration<cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#manage-authentication-tokens>`

To start using the API and run the examples in this section, you need the
following items:

- Rackspace Cloud account. If you don't have an account,
  :rax-cart:`sign up <cloud>` for one.

- :ref:`Command-line tool or browser client <send-api-requests>` for
  communicating with the API service.
